# A network analysis of the energy infrastructure in New York State

This project will investigate the energy infrastructure in New York State and various features that can be collected. We will take a network analysis approach to determine critical features of this infrastructure and how it compares to other discrete networks.

### Nodes
* Coal Mines, Surface and Underground 
* Crude Oil Rail Terminals 
  * Rail terminals that handle the loading and unloading of crude oil.
* Natural Gas Processing Plants
  * Processing plants are midstream facilities that separate natural gas liquids (NGL) from natural gas. Gas processing plants often perform several other functions, as well: dehydration, contaminant removal, and sometimes fractionation (separating an NGL stream into its component products). 
* Natural Gas Market Hubs 
  * Natural gas market hubs in the contiguous United States. A hub is a physical transfer point for natural gas where several pipelines are connected. A market center is a hub where the operator offers services that facilitate the buying, selling, and transportation of natural gas. 
* Natural Gas Underground Storage Facilities
* Liquefied Natural Gas Import/Export Terminals
  * There are more than 110 LNG facilities operating in the U.S. performing a variety of services. Some facilities export natural gas from the U.S., some provide natural gas supply to the interstate pipeline system or local distribution companies, while others are used to store natural gas for periods of peak demand. 
* Oil and Gas Wells
  * Includes probable actively producing oil and gas wells in the United States, excluding Indiana and Illinois. States vary in their collection and processing practices and have varying lags in reporting. For example, reporting for Kentucky and Tennessee will lag years behind other States. Known abandoned, dry, storage and injection wells have been excluded. Gas wells include coalbed methane and CO2. The definition and designation of oil and gas well types vary by State.
Petroleum Product Terminals → Pipeline, Truck, Railcar
Petroleum Refineries → Pipeline, truck, railcar
Power Plants → Electric grid
Wind Turbines → Electric grid

### Edges
* Crude Oil Pipelines
* HGL Pipelines
  * Hydrocarbon gas liquids (HGL) refers to both the natural gas liquids (paraffins or alkanes) and olefins (alkenes) produced by natural gas processing plants, fractionators, crude oil refineries, and condensate splitters but excludes liquefied natural gas (LNG) and aromatics.
* Natural Gas Interstate and Intrastate Pipelines
* Petroleum Product Pipelines
